4.7.1
=====
- Also support the newer AC_CONFIG_HEADERS macro.

4.7.0
=====
- Do @REVISION@ and @LINGUAS@ substitutions in xdt-autogen instead of
  requiring people to put it in their autogen.sh files.
- Also support the newer IT_PROG_INTLTOOL macro
- Added --version and -V options to display the xdt-autogen version
- Added ability for autogen.sh scripts to set an environment
  variable XDT_AUTOGEN_REQUIRED_VERSION to depend on a particular version
  of xdt-autogen.
- Add a bunch more compiler warnings for --enable-debug, and a new macro
  XDT_SUPPORTED_FLAGS() that tests whether the compiler supports particular
  option flags.

4.6.0
=====
- Replace grep -P with awk and thus make the script more portable. Properly 
  detect changed ChangeLogs in SVN. This should get rid the empty lines when 
  committing several changed ChangeLogs (bug #4716). 

4.5.93
======
- Remove unreliable and not really needed intltool auto-patch.

4.5.92
======
- Add support for git (and git-svn) to the xdt-commit script (bug 4491).

4.5.91
======
- Don't try to patch intltool-merge.in for intltool 0.40.x: 0.40.4+ has
  a fix for the bug, and 0.40.x earlier than that aren't patchable as they
  run systemwide versions of the scripts.

4.5.90
======
- Add intltool-merge.in patch to xdt-autogen.in to fix merging translations
  to .desktop keys that have dashes in them.

4.4.2
=====
- Add script (xdt-commit) for generating commit messages from ChangeLogs
  on the fly.
- Remove trailing parens on AC_INIT version info to work around bug
  in intltool 0.35.x and 0.36.x.

4.4.1
=====
- No changes from 4.4.0

4.4.0
=====
- Add support for the latest GNU autotools (Bug #2755).
- Make sure xgettext uses UTF-8 encoding for source files.

4.3.99.2
========
- No changes for Xfce 4.4.0 RC2.

4.3.99.1
========
- GCC specific compiler flags will not be used unless the compiler supports it.

4.3.90.2
========
- Add GPL boilerplate to the installed scripts and macros.

4.3.90.1
========
- G_DISABLE_DEPRECATED is no longer automatically added to CFLAGS in
  XDT_FEATURE_DEBUG().
- The version number is displayed properly now when a required package is
  not found in XDT_CHECK_PACKAGE().

4.3.0
=====
- xfce4-dev-tools is a new module in SVN, which includes tools, macros and
  documentation for Xfce developers.
